# Foodtopia
An online food ordering and delivery portal
This project focuses on creating a hassle-free food delivery online portal which lets the user order from all the restaurants 
present in the city. It displays menu items, cart to store the order as well as an order history of every user.
The project uses HTML, CSS, Javascript for front end, Python flask for server side scripting and SQLite3 for backend database storage.
